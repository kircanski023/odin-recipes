    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line a large-rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
            Press ground chuck into a thin, even 11- x 9-inch rectangle on prepared baking sheet. 
            Sprinkle evenly with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in preheated oven until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of 
            beef registers 140°F to 145°F, about 10 minutes. Using 2 large spatulas, 
            transfer beef to a cutting board lined with paper towels; discard foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line same baking sheet with a new piece of foil; lightly coat with cooking spray. 
            Using a serrated bread knife, cut rolls in half horizontally, 
            keeping top halves and bottom halves intact. 
            Place the bottom half of rolls cut-side up on prepared baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread Big Mac Sauce evenly over bottom half of rolls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place beef patty over sauce, topping evenly with cheese slices, pickles, and onion.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place top half of rolls over pickles and onions. 
            Brush tops and sides of rolls with melted butter, 
            and sprinkle evenly with sesame seeds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in preheated oven until top buns are golden brown and cheese is melted, 
            about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully remove bun tops, sprinkle lettuce in an even layer, and replace bun tops.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut sliders into 12 portions; serve with additional Big Mac Sauce.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Sauce</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk together all ingredients in a small bowl until fully combined.
             Chill in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

    </ol>
