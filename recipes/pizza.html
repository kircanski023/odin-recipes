    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        My favorite sports pub serves this, 
        and I've come up with a simple and delicious home version. 
        Many local restaurants sell wing sauce,
        and most grocery stores carry it near the steak and BBQ sauces.
        It's rich, so serve in squares as an appetizer. 
        Serve ranch dressing, celery, and carrot sticks on the side. Enjoy!
